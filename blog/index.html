       Daniel Cormier proved again Saturday in the co-main event of UFC 220 that he is one of the best mixed martial artists who ever stepped foot into the cage.
       Cormier lived up to his bold pre-fight words, pummeling the heavy-hitting Volkan Oezdemir at TD Garden in Boston and stopping him at two minutes of the second 
       round in a predictably one-sided fight to retain the UFC light heavyweight title. Cormier took Oezdemir down seconds into the second round, then patiently maneuvered into position. 
       From side control, he pinned Oezdemir’s left arm with his knee and landed punches from the top until referee Kevin MacDonald had seen enough and stopped it.
